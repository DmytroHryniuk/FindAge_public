#### Summary [:arrow_up:](#table-of-contents)
_FindAge – app for age determination._
With this app, you can find the age of any person: your mom, grandmom, cousin, or your friend.
Modern design and native interface will help you do this with flying colors.
To find the age, you will need only a person’s date of birth. Simply type the date in using the orange keyboard with the following template: _dd.mm.yyyy._
As soon as the date is complete, the app will automatically determine the age and show it.
To find the age of another person, simply tap on the blue “Restart” button and the app will refresh.

#### Important note: [:arrow_up:](#table-of-contents)
If you found that the date vanished and the screen shook, it means that you typed in:
* wrong day/month/year range;
* a date that does not exist;
* a date in the future.

If you type in the wrong numbers, only a group will be erased.
